# Arduino archive

## Idea
Hey!

I guess you accidentally found this repo. It seems I have a number of Arduino sources and this number is growing.

So I am simply going to throw those here and make notes. Why? I often want to find a pin with LED on a breadboard, connect I²S soundcard or some I²C thermometer without googling in the first place, that's why.

Why I am not using Gist? Because I can make notes here better.

So, deal? I mean, there are videos on YouTube telling you how not to hold the soldering iron by the tip or a barrel, so bear with me.

Still no deal? Fine, whatever.
